# MinesWeeper
 This code is the result of a school lesson and evaluation from the `Java course`
 at [Mines Saint Ã‰tienne, ISMIN cursus](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/formation/master-degree-in-microelectronics-and-computer-science/).

---
## Objectives
 The objectives of this course was to teach Java's fundamentals and evaluate it through
 the creation of an online (with a server) MinesWeeper game as we could previously find in windows' games.
 The game has to be playable without a server (in local).

---
## Rules
The rules are different depending on the type of game (online of local):

### Local
In local mode the rules are the same as the 'usual' MinesWeeper.
You need to click all cases that are not bombs. If you click on a bomb you loose. The objective is then to click all no-bomb cases in a minimum of time (a counter in red show the time taken in seconds).

### Online
The online rule are different from the usual MinesWeeper game.
- In this version the objective is to click the maximum of case without touching a bomb. Contrary to the usual game if you click an empty case (not close from a bomb) only the case clicked will be discovered.
- If everyone hits a bomb the last one alive is the winner.
- Every player has an ID and a color (limited 10 players, after all player a dark gray).
